# Employee Attrition Analysis Capstone Project 
## Overview 
This repository contains the comprehensive capstone project where I leveraged my background as a Human Resources Manager to analyze employee attrition data. The analysis involved using Python for data processing and statistical analysis, as well as Tableau for visualization. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied to derive actionable insights, contributing valuable strategies for optimizing workforce management
## Tools Used 
- **Python:**
  - Data Processing: Utilized Python for processing employee attrition data
  - Statistical Analysis: Employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis and correlation methods for quantitative insights
  - Deriving Insights: Applied various statistical methods to derive actionable insights
- **Tableau:** Utilized for creating interactive visually compelling data visualizations
## Key Insights 
### Correlation Analysis 
- **Overtime and Attrition:** Discovered that overtime had the highest correlation to attrition overall, indicating a significant relationship between extended work hours and employee turnover 
- **Extrinsic Factors and Attrition:** Identified extrinsic factors with the highest correlation to attrition were overtime, followed by business travel, distance from home, and education level  
- **Intrinsic Factors and Attrition:** Discovered that intrinsic factors highly correlated to attrition were job involvement, followed by job satisfaction and environment satisfaction 
- **Intrinsic Factors When Compared With Overtime:** When comparing job involvement with overtime, job involvement emerged as the driving factor. However, when job satisfaction and environment satisfaction were compared with overtime, overtime was the driving factor for attrition. 
### How Other Job Factors Affected Attrition
- **Age Groups and Attrition:** Compared attrition rates across age groups to reveal trends related to which generations have a higher rate of attrition 
- **Job Roles and Attrition:** explored which job roles had the highest attrition rates and what role overtime played to provide a nuanced understanding of workforce dynamics 
- **Impact of Education on Attrition:** investigated how education levels affected attrition rates, providing insights into the relationship between educational qualifications and employee attrition
